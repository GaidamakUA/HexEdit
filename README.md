# HexEdit
Cross platform Hex Editor meant to be used for Rom Hackig.

# About
I wanted to do NES romhacking on Mac OSX but hadn't found any good HexEditors with Table support.
So, that's why I started this project.

It's not fully featured yet, but I'm going to use it myself so expect me to continue working on it.

Current goal is to create simple but functional Hex Editor so I could do RomHacking on MacOS.
End goal is to create modern HexEditor component for JavaFX like HexLib used to be for Swing.
